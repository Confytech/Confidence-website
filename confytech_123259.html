    <p>HOW I GOT STARTED WITH SOFTWARE ENGINEERING</p>
    All
  this started when I was rounding up my NYSC, last year November, sometimes I’ll just sit down and rack my head making some calculations, drafting out things on paper, sometimes I’ll be making scribbles and asking myself what can I do to make the world a better place. Is there anything I could create that could be of relevance to myself, my environment and the world at large? I came up actually with something which I presume to be my long term goal. I want to be able to create a system in Data management that could solve users issues in a second, and also to be an expert in programming languages precisely Java. I told myself that I might not be able to achieve this on my own. I needed an environment void of distractions with people of like mind who would be willing to share in what I believe in and also a mentor or coach who would be ready to lead me through the way. Then I began searching online till I stumbled on decagon. When I read the about, I was like wow! This is going to be a place where I could learn what I needed to learn and utilize what I’ll be taught. I went further to apply and this was how the whole process started. Decagon, thank you for this opportunity!
